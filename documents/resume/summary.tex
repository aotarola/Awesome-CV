%---------------------------------------------------------
Software Engineer with 7+ years of experience, I have worked with Nodejs, Ruby on Rails, PHP, Python and Django framework for the most part of my career.

Currently, I'm working at Groupon as a Software Engineer involved in the team in charge of maintaining and delivery solutions as well as new features to the login/signup and checkout application of the platform.

A bit about myself; I'm a big fan of Service Oriented Systems and Continuous Integration, I like dynamic languages, distributed version control systems like GIT (I love Github BTW), cool editors like VS Code (but, VIM will always be my prefered one!). I also play well with Linux / OS X, Splunk, Wavefront, ELK, and intermediate sysadmin tools (enough to help myself to debug/restore a running app). If I cannot solve an issue, I know how to gather enough data and ask the right person the right question to unblock myself.

I'm very passionate in the things I do, especially if the task is challenging.

I like to create things and/or use the tools/libraries the right way but I'm also aware of delivering badass software at the commited date is at the same level of importance!

And of course I like to learn new stuff / tech !, and finally, I love green tea.
